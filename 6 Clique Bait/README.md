# Case Study #6 - Clique Bait ðŸ–±
Reference: [8 Week SQL Challenge - Clique Bait](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-6/)
***
## Introduction
Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.
***
## Available Data
For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

## Case Study Questions
## A. Enterprise Relationship Diagram
Using the following DDL schema details to create an ERD for all the Clique Bait datasets.

## C. Product Funnel Analysis
#### 1. Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?
```sql

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS product_name_info;
CREATE VIEW product_name_info AS
WITH page_cart_event AS (
SELECT *,
	CASE WHEN event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS page_view,
	CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS add_to_cart
FROM events
JOIN event_identifier
USING (event_type)
JOIN page_hierarchy
USING (page_id)
),
purchase_event AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM page_cart_event
WHERE event_name = 'Purchase'
),
combined_events AS (
SELECT pce.visit_id, page_name, product_category, page_view, add_to_cart,
	CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM page_cart_event pce
LEFT JOIN purchase_event pe
USING (visit_id)
ORDER BY purchase ASC
)
SELECT page_name,
	SUM(page_view) AS total_page_view, 
	SUM(add_to_cart) AS total_add_Cart,
	SUM(CASE WHEN add_to_cart = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_abandoned,
	SUM(CASE WHEN add_to_cart = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_purchase
FROM combined_events
WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY page_name
ORDER BY total_page_view DESC;

```
[Week-6-B-1-A](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-B-1-B.png)
***
#### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
```sql

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS product_category_info;
CREATE VIEW product_category_info AS
WITH page_cart_event AS (
SELECT *,
	CASE WHEN event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS page_view,
	CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS add_to_cart
FROM events
JOIN event_identifier
USING (event_type)
JOIN page_hierarchy
USING (page_id)
),
purchase_event AS (
SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
FROM page_cart_event
WHERE event_name = 'Purchase'
),
combined_events AS (
SELECT pce.visit_id, page_name, product_category, page_view, add_to_cart,
	CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
FROM page_cart_event pce
LEFT JOIN purchase_event pe
USING (visit_id)
ORDER BY purchase ASC
)
SELECT product_category,
	SUM(page_view) AS total_page_view, 
	SUM(add_to_cart) AS total_add_Cart,
	SUM(CASE WHEN add_to_cart = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_abandoned,
	SUM(CASE WHEN add_to_cart = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_purchase
FROM combined_events
WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_page_view DESC;

```
[Week-6-A-1](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-A-1.png)
***
#### Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:
#### 2. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
```sql

SELECT total_page_view,
	CASE WHEN total_page_view = MAX(total_page_view) OVER() THEN page_name ELSE NULL END AS most_views,
	total_add_cart,
	CASE WHEN total_add_cart = MAX(total_add_cart) OVER() THEN page_name ELSE NULL END AS most_add_carts,
	total_purchase,
	CASE WHEN total_purchase = MAX(total_purchase) OVER() THEN page_name ELSE NULL END AS most_purchase
FROM product_name_info
GROUP BY page_name, total_page_view, total_add_cart, total_purchase;

```
[Week-6-B-2](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-B-2.png)
***
#### 3. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
```sql

SELECT total_abandoned,
	CASE WHEN total_abandoned = MAX(total_abandoned) OVER() THEN page_name ELSE NULL END AS most_abandoned
FROM product_name_info
ORDER BY most_abandoned;

```
[Week-6-B-3](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-B-3.png)
***
#### 4. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
```sql

SELECT page_name, 
	ROUND(100.00 * total_purchase / total_page_view, 2) AS view_to_purchase_perc
FROM product_name_info
ORDER BY view_to_purchase_perc DESC;

```
[Week-6-B-4](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-B-4.png)
***
#### 5. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
```sql

SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG((100.00 * total_add_cart / total_page_view)), 2) AS avg_conversion_view_to_cart
FROM product_name_info;

```
[Week-6-B-5](CliqueBaitOutput/Week-6-B-5.png)
***
#### 6. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
```sql

SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG((100.00 * total_purchase / total_add_cart)), 2) AS avg_conversion_cart_to_purchase
FROM product_name_info;

```

## C. Campaigns Analysis
#### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- user_id
- visit_id
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
```sql

SELECT user_id, 
	   visit_id,
	   MIN(event_time) AS visit_start_time,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_views,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
	   campaign_name,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
	   STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN product_id IS NOT NULL AND event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN page_name ELSE NULL END, ', ' ORDER BY sequence_number) AS cart_products
FROM users
JOIN events
USING (cookie_id)
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier c
ON event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy
USING (page_id)
JOIN event_identifier
USING (event_type)
GROUP BY user_id, visit_id, campaign_name

```
