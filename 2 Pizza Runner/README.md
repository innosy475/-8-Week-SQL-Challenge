# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner üçï
Reference: [8 Week SQL Challenge - Pizza Runner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)
***
## Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
***
## Available Data

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

## Case Study Questions
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones you‚Äôd like to try!

Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

#### Cleaning runner_orders table
```sql

UPDATE runner_orders
SET 
	pickup_time = CASE WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE pickup_time END,
	distance = CASE WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE distance END,
	duration = CASE WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE duration END,
	cancellation = CASE WHEN cancellation = 'null' OR cancellation = '' THEN NULL ELSE cancellation END;

UPDATE runner_orders
SET 
	distance = TRIM('km' FROM distance),
	duration = TRIM('minutes' FROM duration);

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE FLOAT
USING distance::FLOAT;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INTEGER
USING duration::INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE NUMERIC;

```
***
#### Cleaning customer_orders table
```sql

UPDATE customer_orders
SET
	exclusions = CASE WHEN exclusions = '' OR exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE exclusions END,
	extras = CASE WHEN extras = '' OR extras = 'null' THEN NULL ELSE extras END;

#### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```sql

-- create schema for runner ratings
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS pizza_runner_rating;
CREATE SCHEMA pizza_runner_rating;
SET search_path = pizza_runner_rating;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_ratings;
CREATE TABLE runner_ratings (
	"runner_id" INTEGER,
	"runner_rating" INTEGER,
	"order_id" INTEGER,
	"duration" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO runner_ratings (
	"runner_id", "order_id", "duration", "runner_rating"
)
SELECT runner_id, order_id, duration,
CASE 
	WHEN duration <= 15 THEN 5
	WHEN duration > 15 AND duration <= 20 THEN 4
	WHEN duration > 20 AND duration <= 25 THEN 3
	WHEN duration > 25 AND duration <= 30 THEN 2
	WHEN duration > 31 THEN 1
	ELSE NULL
END AS runner_rating
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

SET search_path = pizza_runner_rating;

SELECT *
FROM runner_ratings;

```
![Week-2-D-3](PizzaRunnerOutput/Week-2-D-3.png)
***
#### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas
```sql

SET search_path = pizza_runner;
WITH all_orders AS (
SELECT co.customer_id AS customer_id, 
	   co.order_id AS order_id, 
	   ro.runner_id AS runner_id, 
	   runner_rating, 
	   order_time, 
	   pickup_time, 
	   ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - order_time))/60, 2) AS prep_time,
	   ro.duration AS duration,
	   ROUND(distance * 60/ro.duration, 2) AS speed  --speed = (km/hr)(distance/duration) || duration = min(1hr/60min)
FROM runner_ratings 
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders ro
USING (order_id)
JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders co
USING (order_id)
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *, COUNT (*) AS pizza_count
FROM all_orders
GROUP BY customer_id, 
	   order_id, 
	   runner_id, 
	   runner_rating, 
	   order_time, 
	   pickup_time,
	   duration,
	   prep_time,
	   all_orders.speed;

```

***
#### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```sql

SELECT '$ ' || SUM(pizza_sales) AS total_sales
FROM(SELECT pizza_name,
CASE
	WHEN pizza_name = 'Meat Lovers' THEN pizza_count * 12 - (total_distance * 0.3)
	WHEN pizza_name = 'Vegetarian' THEN pizza_count * 10 - (total_distance * 0.3)
	ELSE NULL
END AS pizza_sales
FROM (
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(distance) AS total_distance, COUNT(*) AS pizza_count
FROM runner_orders
JOIN customer_orders
USING (order_id)
JOIN pizza_names
USING (pizza_id)
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
