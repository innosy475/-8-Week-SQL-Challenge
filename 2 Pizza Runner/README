# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner üçï
Reference: [8 Week SQL Challenge - Pizza Runner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)
***
## Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
***
## Available Data

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

## Case Study Questions
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones you‚Äôd like to try!

Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!





#### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql

SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM menu m
JOIN sales s
USING (product_id)
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(m.price) DESC;

```

***
#### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```sql

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_days_visited
FROM sales

ON sales.customer_id = fd.customer_id
AND sales.order_date = fd.first_date
ORDER BY customer_id;

```

***
#### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
```sql

SELECT customer_id, product_name, sold_count, product_rank
FROM (SELECT customer_id, product_name, COUNT(product_name) AS sold_count,

	ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS product_rank
	FROM menu
	JOIN sales
	USING (product_id)
	GROUP BY customer_id, product_name

![Week-1-A-8](Danny's%20Diner%20Output/Week-1-A-8.png)
***
#### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
```sql

SELECT customer_id, SUM(points)
FROM (SELECT product_name, customer_id,
CASE 
	WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * price * 10
	ELSE price * 10
END AS points
FROM menu
JOIN sales
USING (product_id))
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;

```

***
#### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```sql

SELECT customer_id, SUM(points)
FROM (SELECT customer_id, count_days, product_name,
CASE
	WHEN count_days BETWEEN 0 AND 8 THEN 2 * price * 10
	WHEN product_name = 'sushi' AND count_days < 0 AND count_days > 8 THEN 2 * price * 10
	ELSE 10 * price
END AS points
FROM (SELECT customer_id, product_name, price, join_date, order_date, order_date - join_date AS count_days
FROM members
JOIN sales
USING (customer_id)
JOIN menu
USING (product_id)
WHERE order_date < '2021-02-01'))
GROUP BY customer_id;

```

## Bonus Questions
### Join All The Things
#### The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.
#### Recreate the following table output using the available data:

### Rank All The Things
#### Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

<div class="responsive-table">

  <table>
    <thead>

        <th>customer_id</th>
