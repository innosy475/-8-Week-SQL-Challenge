--A. Customer Journey
--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans
USING (plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18 ,19);

--From the eight sample customers provided in the subscriptions table, all of them subscribed to a trial before choosing another plan. Only two customers from the sample did not continue their subscription.


--B. Data Analysis Questions
-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT SUM(customer_count) AS total_costumers
FROM (
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count, plan_id, plan_name
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans
USING (plan_id)
WHERE plan_id <> 4
GROUP BY plan_id, plan_name
);

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_subs;
CREATE VIEW customer_subs AS
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans
USING (plan_id);

SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month_num, 
	TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') AS month, 
	COUNT(*) AS trial_subs
FROM customer_subs
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date), TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month')
ORDER BY month_num ASC;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT plan_name, COUNT(*) AS plan_breakdown
FROM customer_subs
WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;

-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS churn_count,
	   ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customer_subs), 1) AS churn_perc
FROM customer_subs

-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

WITH next_sub AS (

FROM next_sub_date
WHERE next_date IS NULL
GROUP BY plan_id;
-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS pro_annual_subs
FROM customer_subs
WHERE plan_name = 'pro annual' AND start_date <= '2020-12-31';

-- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_date
FROM customer_subs
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'

SELECT ROUND(AVG(annual_plan_date - trial_date), 2) AS avg_days
FROM trial_sub ts
JOIN annual_sub
USING (customer_id);

-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

WITH trial_sub AS (
SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_date
FROM customer_subs
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'

bin AS (
SELECT
	WIDTH_BUCKET(annual_plan_date - trial_date, 0, 365, 12) AS days_to_upgrade
FROM trial_sub
JOIN annual_sub
USING (customer_id)
)
SELECT
CASE
	WHEN days_to_upgrade - 1 = 0 THEN (days_to_upgrade - 1	) * 30 || ' - ' || days_to_upgrade * 30
	ELSE (days_to_upgrade - 1) * 30 + 1 || ' - ' || days_to_upgrade * 30
END AS bucket_day_period,
COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM bin
GROUP BY days_to_upgrade
ORDER BY days_to_upgrade;
