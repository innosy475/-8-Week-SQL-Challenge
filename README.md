# -8-Week-SQL-Challenge
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a free, self-paced learning project created by Danny Ma, a data professional and founder of Data With Danny. It‚Äôs designed to help people improve their SQL skills through hands-on case studies that simulate real-world business scenarios.

Here are my solutions for every case study in Danny Ma's SQL challenge:

Feel free to leave a comment in any of the case study that I've solved.

# About me

I took on this challenge to strengthen my SQL skills, especially since I don‚Äôt have any formal work experience in this field yet. It took me two weeks to complete all of Danny Ma‚Äôs challenges, and through the process, I learned far more than I ever did from YouTube tutorials or DataCamp courses. This project truly deepened my understanding of SQL and improved my querying skills.

My goal is to become a Data Engineer, and this marks the beginning of my journey in building a strong portfolio of projects.
